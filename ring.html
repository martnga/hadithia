<h1 align=center>The ring of Alberich</h1>
		The five-member team stood gazing out across Iceland’s vast Vatnajökull glacier. One got the impression of a frozen desert, with the sunshine reflecting off the glacier’s uneven surface, and the wind swirled top layer of loose granular ice and snow.

Clive Thurston, treasure-hunter and the team leader, studied the cloudless sky, his thoughts on discovering the lost treasures of Niebelungen, supposedly stolen by Loki and kept in his temple. Off to his right, he could see Hugo Strom, a big strapping man, speaking with their elderly guide in the native language. Thurston chuckled to himself at the thought of calling their guide elderly. True, Ulf Bjornstad was in his seventies, but he still had as much vitality as a man half his age. Unlike the rest of the team who wore heavy parkas and thick gloves, their guide wore little more than a gray-white fur vest over a thick woolen shirt. After the conversation ended, Strom hiked up his backpack and made his way over to Thurston.

“Our guide says that an abandoned, ancient, temple to Loki was exposed after an earthquake and lies just ahead, along the southern edge of the Grimsvōtn caldera,” Hugo said, his English only slightly tainted by his Icelandic ancestry.

Thurston called out to his longtime friend and associate, Daniel Alcott, “Daniel, mark our present location on the map and give me a distance on the Grimsvōtn crater.”

Daniel unrolled the map and estimated the distance, “I’d wager that it is about eight kilometers from our present location.”

The team leader turned to his left and spoke to a ruddy faced man, “Reginald, write this down: 25 July 1911. Temperature is steady at 52°. We are but eight kilometers from our goal, a lost temple of the trickster god Loki.”

Reginald Gledhill, “Reggie” to his friends, wrote down the information in the logbook. Tucking the book inside his parka, Reggie quickly donned his thick woolen gloves.

“Let’s be off then, shall we?” Clive Thurston said as he pulled up the hood of his parka.

The trek to the crater was uneventful; the only other sign of life besides the men was a lone Arctic Fox, its gray-white fur blending in nicely with its surroundings. Bjornstad raised his right hand and commented in his native tongue. The fox offered a quick bark in return and trotted off.

Reginald, uncomfortable with wildlife of any kind, questioned the translator, “What did he just say?”

“He told the fox that we mean no harm and that we have the blessing of Loki.”

For some reason, that made Gledhill more nervous than the fox did. He did not hold with pagan gods and their rituals, but the money promised him would be more than he could make in a year.

Upon reaching the crater’s edge, the guide gestured to a small gulley and headed down. Hugo went next, followed by Clive, then Daniel, with Reginald Gledhill bringing up the rear. At the bottom of the frozen rivulet was a cave opening into the side of the volcanic crater.


The guide stood aside as the rest of the men entered the ice cave. The lights reflected off the ice walls. Reginald was the only team member who could walk without hunching over, being the only one under six feet tall. The team weaved their way through columns formed by the joining of stalagmites and stalactites.

“Here are the columns you wanted mate,” quipped Alcott, patting one of the frozen monoliths.

“Yes well, I still do not care for this underground business,” replied Gledhill.

A little over 10 meters, and the cave became more spacious, allowing the men to stand up straight. At the rear of the cavern rose several steps, carved from the ice. An enormous, ice encrusted, altar rested atop the stairs. An intricately hand carved chalice sat in the center of the altar top. Oddly enough, the chalice was free of ice.

Daniel Alcott reached the altar first, running his gloved hand over the top and sides, displacing some of the loose ice. Beneath the ice, he found the altar inscribed with deep rune markings.

“Reggie, bring your torch over here.”

Reluctantly, Reginald moved closer, shining his light onto the altar top. He could see the grooves, but had no idea what they meant. Reggie shifted from foot to foot, anxious to be away from the altar and out of the cavern.

After a moment, Reggie asked, “Can you make out what it says?”

“Patience mate, I am a little rusty.”

Reggie muttered, “Probably a death curse.”  The shiver up his spine had nothing to do with the cold.

Strom and Thurston explored the cavern walls, and came upon a niche covered by a sheet of ice, almost like a window. Clive directed his torchlight inside. It looked as if something lay beyond the makeshift glass. He tapped the end of his light against the ice, barely making a mark.

“See if you can break the ice Hugo.”

Strom reached into his backpack and withdrew an ice-climber pickax. Clive stepped back to give him room.  Hugo drew back a powerful arm and slammed the pickax dead center, the ice shattered, sounding like the crack of a bullwhip.
